# Stopwatch-Website
Welcome to my Stopwatch site â€“ a simple website I created for honing JavaScript skills. With just five buttons (Start, Stop, Reset, Lap, Clear Laps), it's perfect for quick coding practice. The clean design keeps it distraction-free, ideal for both beginners and experienced developers.

## Features

- Start, Stop, and Reset the timer.
- Record lap times.
- Clear lap times.
